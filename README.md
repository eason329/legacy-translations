# locale (legacy repository)

This is the legacy translation repository for LuckPerms version `< 5.2`.

For version `>= 5.2`, translations are now managed on [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/luckperms).

**This fork will attempt to move the translation on Crowdin into here for servers that refused to update their LuckPerms.**

## How to install the locale (for version `< 5.2`)

1. download the locale file you want to use.
2. rename it to `lang.yml`.
3. put it onto `\LuckPerms` folder.

## For owners that using version `>= 5.2` on their server

You don't need to download anything here. You just need to run `/luckperms translations` on servser's console or on your chat. It will download the locale files into your server's storage automaticially.

Run `/luckperms` to check the version you're using.

## For translators

Please go to LuckPerms' [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/luckperms) translation project page to translate. If you haven't found your language there, feel free to ask Lucko to add your language.

## If you have further questions
